# C-projects

This repository consists of my projects from the time when i was learning C language on cs50, a programme offerd Harvard University on C language.

## Projects:

Caesar:
The first project was to make a program which encrypts the plaintext to ciphertext.
This project helped me understand about terminal inputs from argc and argv and the fail cases that may happen when working with alphabets.

Readability:
This project was to make a program which determines the grade of the provided text and hence determining its readability.
This project helped me understand how to work better with loops and how to take care of fail cases and to find its grade using the Coleman-Liau index.
