# C-projects

This repository consists of my projects from the time when i was learning C language on cs50, a programme offerd Harvard University on C language.

## Projects:

Caesar:
The first project was to make a program which encrypts the plaintext to ciphertext with a key which adds key to the ASCII value for each character to print the encrypted characters.
This project helped me understand about terminal inputs from argc and argv and the fail cases that may happen when working with alphabets and this encryption used integer keys.

Substitution:
This project entailed making a program which encrypts the plaintext to ciphertext using a set of alphabets in a different order than usual.
This project helped me understand usage of string related functions for checking alphabets for a requirement and modifying them to the required.
This project uses a different set of characters of alphabets(e.g., cdbartuvnmpolikjqweszxfghy) to encrypt the given text in the given example manner.

Readability:
This project was to make a program which determines the grade of the provided text and hence determining its readability.
This project helped me understand how to work better with loops and how to take care of fail cases and to find its grade using the Coleman-Liau index.
