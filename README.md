# C-projects

This repository consists of my projects from the time when i was learning C language on cs50, a programme offerd Harvard University on C language.

## Projects:

Caesar:
The first project was to make a program which encrypts the plaintext to ciphertext with a key which adds key to the ASCII value for each character to print the encrypted characters.
This project helped me understand about terminal inputs from argc and argv and the fail cases that may happen when working with alphabets and this encryption used integer keys.

Substitution:
This project entailed making a program which encrypts the plaintext to ciphertext using a set of alphabets in a different order than usual.
This project helped me understand usage of string related functions for checking alphabets for a requirement and modifying them to the required.
This project uses a different set of characters of alphabets(e.g., cdbartuvnmpolikjqweszxfghy) to encrypt the given text in the given example manner.

Readability:
This project was to make a program which determines the grade of the provided text and hence determining its readability.
This project helped me understand how to work better with loops and how to take care of fail cases and to find its grade using the Coleman-Liau index.

Runoff:
This project was based on making a election voting system by eliminating candidates on basis of ranks and looping it till a winner is determined.
It helped me in understanding the working of defining structures and repeating a process and eliminating candidates and working with the cases when votes are equal.

Filters:
This project consisted making a program which could mutate an image and thus filter it according to the need.
In this program, the filters i've worked on are grayscaling, blurring, reflecting image horizontally and highlighting the edges of objects.
This program has taught me to work with RGB values to mutate a image to the required result and also to use 2-D arrays to work with images.

Speller:
This project consisted of making a program to load a dictionary, read it and checking for any misspelled words according to the dictionary.
This project helped me work with different libraries and using them to understand file I/O and using system time to account for time taken to do loading, reading, unloading dictionary and total time taken for this process and hence encouraged me to optimise the code to take less time and achieve the same result.
